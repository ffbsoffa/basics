This sound scheme was inspired from Windows® 3.1/95/98 and original BeOS® sound schemes and intented to use in Haiku OS. Older operating systems and applications has it's own interesting UI aesthetics (including sound schemes). In this case, BeOS was the great example of simplicity, combined with the colorful experience.

Received 3rd place in the Haiku's System Sound Contest, see more at https://www.haiku-os.org/news/2020-12-07-contest-results/.

This scheme is intended to be updated with the process of development of operating system.
