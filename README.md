# 'Basics' (sound scheme for Haiku OS)

This sound scheme was inspired from Windows® 3.1/95/98 and original BeOS® sound schemes and intented to use in Haiku OS. Older operating systems and applications has it's own interesting UI aesthetics (including sound schemes). In this case BeOS is the great example of simplicity, combined with the colorful experience, originaly intended for use with BeBox (computer).

Received 3rd place in the Haiku's System Sound Contest.
This scheme is intended to be updated
